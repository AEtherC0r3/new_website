# [TechMinistry](http://www.techministry.gr/) - New website for Thessaloniki's Hackerspace

## What is the TechMinistry?

A **120m^2 space** dedicated to creative software and hardware hacking. Tech communities, meetups and individuals now have their own space in Thessaloniki.

TechMinistry provides a 3D printer, electronics, as well as a fully equipped lab that can help you prototype your idea.
Moreover, you can get in touch with the city's brightest minds; makers, coders, ninjas, engineers, and designers meet here.

The space is maintained thanks to the contributions of our (awesome) members and supporters.

## Website redesign

The TM website was redesigned in order to increase the visibilty of the hackerspace, as well as to more effectively promote the events and projects that take place on a daily basis at the hackerspace. 

We used [Creative](http://ironsummitmedia.github.io/startbootstrap-creative/), a template based on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) front-end framework for modern and mobile responsive web projects.

We have also deployed our own instance of the open source discussion platfom Discource, available [here](http://discourse.techministry.gr/).
