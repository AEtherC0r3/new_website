# TechMinistry (Thessaloniki's Hackerspace) new website (http://www.techministry.gr/)

## What is TechMinistry?

A **120m2 space** dedicated to creative software and hardware hacking. Tech communities, meetups, and individuals they now have their own space in Thessaloniki.

TechMinistry provides a 3D printer, electronics, as well as a fully equipped lab that can help you prototype your idea.
Moreover, you can get in touch with the city's brightest minds: makers, coders, ninjas, engineers, and designers meet here.

The space is maintained thanks to our (awesome) members' and supporters' contributions.

## Website redesign

The TM website was redesigned in order to increase the visibilty of the hackerspace, as well as to promote the events and projects that take place in a daily basis at the hackerspace more effectively. 

We used the Bootstrap HTML, CSS, and JS framework for responsive and mobile first web projects and the "Creative" template (http://ironsummitmedia.github.io/startbootstrap-creative/). 
We are also going to use the open source discussion platfom Discource (you can check it here: http://discourse.techministry.gr/).
